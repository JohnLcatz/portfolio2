    <main>
        <p>I am Eljohn Nelquisedec, a 14-year-old student currently attending Sci High. I'm in grade 9, section Fire, and I'm estimated to be around 5 feet 7 inches tall. So far, life is treating me well, and I'm enjoying my time in school. As I navigate through my teenage years, I'm exploring new subjects, making new friends, and setting goals for my future. Sci High provides a challenging and stimulating environment, which keeps me engaged and motivated. Whether it's tackling difficult assignments, participating in extracurricular activities, or simply spending time with classmates, I'm making the most of my high school experience and looking forward to what the future holds.</p>
